**Software Workflow**

**OverView**

There is only one repo and one engineering is using github and the other wasnt, this is to help organzie the work the both engineers work on.


**Kyle's Workflow**


**Intial State**

Between tasks we assume kyle has the main branch checked out, also assume he is in sync with origin remote and doesnt have any files to commit and is updated with origin.


**Kyle gets a new task**

- Kyle will create a new branch of off main.
- kyle will then do a push to create a tracking branch.
- Kyle does his development.
- Kyle might do commits and pushes while he is working on the task.
- When the task is done, Kyle makes sure his local files are up to date with origin.
- Kyle creates a pr(pull request), Kyle merges his pull request (this way main has the new changes).
- Kyle can make a release (the release will notes will have an explaination of what is in the release).


**Zipfile Workflow**

The Initial State is the same as kyle's workflow.


**A new Zipfile arrives**

- Create a new branch of off main.
- Kyle will then do a push to create a tracking branch.
- Unzip the zip file in the directory
- Stage, Commit and push all the changes.
- Pull request of that branch, merge it then make a release.

**Have a meaning names for the branches to recognize it**

Have a synamtic version naming convention
